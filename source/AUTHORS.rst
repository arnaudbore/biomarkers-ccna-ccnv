Overview
::::::::

Team 9 "discovering new biomarkers" of the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) is co-lead by Dr Roger Dixon, department of Psychology, University of Alberta, and Dr [Pierre Bellec](https://simexp.github.io/lab-website/team.html), department of Psychology, University of Montreal. The generation of imaging biomarkers using standardized pipelines is one of the core objective of the CCNA biomarkers team, and involves only a subset of investigators, listed below. These imaging biomarkers cover all imaging modalities collected as part of the "comprehensive assessment of neurodegeneration in aging" (COMPASS-ND) cohort, following the Canadian Dementia Imaging Protocol ([CDIP](https://www.cdip-pcid.ca/)).  

Funding
::::::::

The Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging is supported by a grant from the Institutes of Health Research with funding from several partners including the Alzheimer Society of Canada, Sanofi, and Women’s Brain Health Initiative. Team 9 is also receiving funds from the Alberta Innovates (PI Dr Dixon) and the Courtois foundation (PI Bellec).
