Image acquisition
:::::::::::::::::

COMPASS-ND participants are scanned using the Canadian Dementia Imaging Protocol (`CDIP <https://www.cdip-pcid.ca/>`_). CDIP is organized around a central, tri-vendor (GE Healthcare, Philips Medical and Siemens Medical Systems MRI) harmonized core protocol of acquisitions. It is compressed to fit a 45-minutes window, which consists of six sequences:

- 3D T1-weighted 
- T2/PD-weighted
- FLAIR
- T2*
- Diffusion imaging
- BOLD connectivity (resting state)

Prrovided below are the CDIP protocols for the:

**3D T1-weighted scan**

3D isotropic T1-weighted (T1w) imaging were obtained for assessing fine anatomical detail with high resolution (voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm3) and acceleration factor of 2 (GE: FSPGR; Philips: T1-TFE; Siemens: MP-RAGE).


**Resting-state Functional MRI (rsfMRI)**

Functional T2*-weighted images are obtained using a blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) sensitive single-shot echo-planar (EPI) sequence on the GE Healthcare, Philips Medical or Siemens Medical Systems MRI scanners. During the rsfMRI acquisitions, no specific cognitive tasks are performed, and participants are instructed to keep their eyes open. No camera or physiological recordings are captured, as these equipments are not available at every site.
