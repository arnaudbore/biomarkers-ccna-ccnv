Image acquisition
:::::::::::::::::

COMPASS-ND participants are scanned using the Canadian Dementia Imaging Protocol (`CDIP <https://www.cdip-pcid.ca/>`_).

**Resting-state Functional MRI**

Functional T2*-weighted images are obtained using a blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) sensitive single-shot echo-planar (EPI) sequence on the GE, Philips or Siemens scanner makes. During the rsfMRI acquisitions, no specific cognitive tasks are performed, and participants are instructed to keep their eyes open. No camera or physiological recordings are captured, as these equipments are not available at every site.
