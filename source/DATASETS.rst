CCNA
The pan-Canadian cohort on Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND) assembled by the CCNA provides an opportunity to study the full spectrum of age-related dementias. Data collection on 2,310 individuals (ages 50-90) is projected to be completed by May 2020, and will feature individuals with the following cognitive conditions: AD dementia (N=150), other dementias (N=600), subjective cognitive impairment (N=300), MCI (N=400), vascular-MCI (N=200), and CN (N=660). Currently, 969 of 2,310 individuals have been recruited, of which there are 82 AD dementia, 276 MCI, 122 CN. All participants are being deeply phenotyped with extensive clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, biospecimen and neuropathological assessments.
